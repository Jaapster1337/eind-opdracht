### Introduction

Welcome, gamers. This is the github repo for The Game Recommendation Engine. This is a project for an FSD bootcamp i did for NOVI.
The purpose is to let you get some recommendations for video games (Shocking, isn't it?). It does this by letting you choose a genre and a platform
and returning a pseudo-randomized list of 10 games. While you're here, why not give it a try!

### System-requirements
This should work on any modern browser, but for the love of god, don't try and use this on edge. You'll save both of us a big headache.
It also looks by far the best on desktops so let's agree to not use it on other devices, okay? Great!

###Installation-guide
1. An IDE is necessary to run this project. Anything that supports React+Vite and JavaScript will do but I suggest [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
2. Go to the [github page of this project](https://github.com/Jaapster1337/eind-opdracht)
3. Click the "<> Code"-button
4. Copy the SSH link
5. In Webstorm go to File -> New -> Project from Version Control (if you're using a different IDE you can look up "How to clone a project from GIT")
6. Paste the copied link into the box that says URL
7. Press "Clone" and trust this project (I promise it's save)
8. Now you should see the filestructure or a downloadbar in the bottom-right of Webstorm
9. Do NPM Install (Webstorm might ask you to do this by itself)
    9a. To do NPM install manually, open the terminal (default hotkey: Alt+F12)
    9b. Type **"npm install"**
    9c. Wait for the install to finish
10. When the download is done you can type **'NPM run dev'** in the terminal
11. This should be everything you need to do to get it to work

If you run into any issues getting this to work, feel free to contact me through Github and we'll see if we can get it to work
